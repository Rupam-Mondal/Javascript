## Problem 1
Palindrome Checker Function

Objective: Write a JavaScript function isPalindrome(str) that checks if a given string str is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
Example:
Input: isPalindrome("racecar")
Output: true
Input: isPalindrome("hello")
Output: false


## Problem 2
FizzBuzz Function

Objective: Implement a function fizzBuzz(n) in JavaScript that prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
Example:
Input: fizzBuzz(5)
Output: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz

## Problem 3
Factorial Calculator

Objective: Create a JavaScript function calculateFactorial(num) that returns the factorial of a given positive integer num. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.
Example:
Input: calculateFactorial(5)
Output: 120 (as 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120)
