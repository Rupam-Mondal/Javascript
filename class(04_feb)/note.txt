this keyword is far far diff from java and c++.

it can be used in classes and object and also in function

what does this keyword refer to??
--> i) wherever you see this keyword is being used without arrow functions
       at those places this keyword refers to call site. site(whoever is calling your this)
        ex :- demo1.js and demo2.js

    ii) for arrow functions this keyword doesn't refer to call site but instead is resolved
        throught lexical scoping.
        ex :- demo3.js.. for arrow it is so interesting
