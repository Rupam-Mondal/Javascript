promise:-
      The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an 
      asynchronous operation and its resulting value.



.then:-
      The then() method of Promise instances takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the fulfilled and rejected cases of the Promise. It immediately returns an equivalent Promise object, 
      allowing you to chain calls to other promise methods.
      it helps to register task in on full fillment and
      onrejection array... remember that


priority of micro task quese is more than call back queue.

when rejection handler is missing we can use "catch" function..


you can use .catch in btn of chaining because it also returns a promise..
