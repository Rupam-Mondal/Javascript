async function always return a promise
while excution if function hits await it it will throw you from function


after fulfilling the promise then it only will go to the function
but if main thread is block then it will not go to the funtion (remember it carefully)


if you reject any function it will terminate the code execution
so that is the rason you have to use try and catch block

It can only be used inside an async function
